My first program for Python programming course. Documentation for technical writing task.

# Overview
This document will explain step-by-step how to run the program game.py on **Linux Ubuntu** in 4 simple steps.

**Step 1** Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer or install it.
**Step 2** Download the source code from a GitHub repository.
**Step 3** Run the program.
**Step 4** Play hangman.

# Step 1

Linux distributions may include an outdated version of Python (Python 2), but you should install an updated one (Python 3)

*Remember to be careful while using the command line, because you may accidentely damage or remove your data. Write only commands that you known exactly what is their purpose.*

**Access to a command-line/terminal window on Linux:**

                   Ctrl-Alt-T, Ctrl-Alt-F2
    
**To find out which version of Python is installed, type the command:** 

                    python --version

        
- If your version is Python 3.7.x (x stands for the revision level and could change as new releases come out), go to **Step 2**.

- You can **update** your Python version by writing **sudo apt-get install python3** in the terminal

- To **install** Python 3, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
If you are a beginner, I reccomend reading the guide https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide as well.

More details on Python can be found on the [official Python page](https://www.python.org/about/)
and on its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).


# Step 2
Now, you need to download the source code of the Python program you want to run from Github.

##### [Click to go to the Github repository.](https://github.com/MartynaIwaniec/wisielecUG)

You can **download** either:
- **a single Python source code** file
(with extension ".py")
First, click on **wisielec.py** to go to the specific file. Then, click on **Raw** to open the raw source code. Then, you can copy and save it into a new file.

- or **a ZIP file containing the Python file
and the documentation** (which you are currently reading).

- It is also possible to access the source code with **git** command. To find out more, go to [Github page]( https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository )!

When you have cloned the .py file, go to the next step.

# Step 3

- Open up the terminal program, open the main menu and select "Run Command..." to open Console. 
In GNOME, open the main menu, open the Applications folder, open the Accessories folder, and select Terminal.
    Type cd ~/pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter.
    Don't forget to make the script executable by chmod +x.
    Type python ./hello.py to run your program!
